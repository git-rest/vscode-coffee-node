## VSCode + CoffeeScript

**Prerequisites**

- Install VS Code
- `npm i -g coffeescript mocha should`
- Clone this repo
- `npm i` inside the repo

**Use this template**

- Write your code in `/src`
- Use `npm run build` to compile to JS in `/lib`
- Write your tests in `/test`
- Use `npm test` to run all tests
- Run your program with `npm start`

Tasks are configured to enable interactive debugging in VS Code. Just open the debug panel and run the `Coffee` configuration. Sources will be built and then debugged.
